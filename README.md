# to-do-list

Worked on as part of The Odin Project

Instructions:
1. To begin, click either Add List or New To-Do.
2. Add and remove To-Dos as you please from each list you create.
3. To-Dos will be color-coded by priority. High: Red, Medium: Orange, Low: Green.
3. Data will be stored for the next time you visit the page.
4. Enjoy!

- Home page should display all active to-do items.
- Still working on fixing some updating and display bugs.
